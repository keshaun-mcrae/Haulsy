# Copywriting Style — Haulsy

**Voice:** calm, direct, helpful.  
**Vibe:** Apple clean + Marketplace familiar.  
**Goal:** reduce friction, push toward a plan (pickup/delivery).

---

## Principles
1. **Short > clever**: fewer words, clearer meaning.
2. **Action-first**: buttons start with verbs (“Message”, “Request delivery”).
3. **No fluff**: avoid “Hey there!” / “Awesome!” unless it adds clarity.
4. **Next step always visible**: UI should suggest what to do next.
5. **Friendly but neutral**: no slang, no guilt, no hype.

---

## Formatting Rules
- Buttons: 1–2 words (verb + object)
- Chips: 1–3 words
- Headings: <= 5 words
- Helper text: 1 sentence max
- Errors: say what happened + what to do next

---

## Preferred Words
Use:
- “Message”, “Offer”, “Pickup”, “Delivery”, “Schedule”, “Confirm”, “Mark sold”
- “Pending” (when a plan is set)
- “View original” for translations

Avoid:
- “Submit” (use “Publish”, “Send”, “Confirm”)
- “Proceed” (use “Continue”)
- “Oops” (use “Couldn’t load”)

---

## Core CTAs (standardized)
- Primary: **Message**
- Secondary: **Request delivery**
- Sell: **Next**, **Publish**
- Chat: **Send**, **Propose time**, **Make offer**
- Earn: **Accept**, **Start pickup**, **Complete dropoff**
